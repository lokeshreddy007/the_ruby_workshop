# The Ruby Workshop

Ruby is a dynamic, interpreted, object-oriented programming language developed by
Yukihiro ("Matz") Matsumoto

#### Key Features of Ruby

A number of key features of the Ruby language make it really unique in terms of working
with it. It has very neatly assimilated the best features of many programming languages.
Here are a few features of Ruby that make it a delight to program with:
• Object-oriented
• Interpreted language
• Duck typing and dynamic typing
• Multi-paradigm language
• Reflection
• Metaprogramming

#### Object-Oriented

Ruby is thoroughly object-oriented, and objects are the basic building block of a Ruby
program. Every value in Ruby is an object, even data types such as strings, numbers, and
Booleans: everything is an object. This means that every object is part of a class that
gives access to a wide range of methods to do incredible things

#### Interpreted Language

Ruby is an interpreted language, meaning that it's ready to run the program as soon as
you finish typing

#### Duck Typing and Dynamic Typing

Dynamic typing means a variable can refer to objects of various types when the
program is executed. There is no type checking in Ruby. Duck typing is a principle
that denotes that an object is based on the value assigned to it rather than the type of
variable.

#### Multi-paradigm Language

While languages are focused on one type of programming paradigm, besides being
object-oriented, Ruby also allows procedural and functional styles of programming. The
procedural paradigm refers to an instance where procedure calls are interpreted as
function calls.

#### Reflection

Reflection in Ruby makes it very easy to understand what's happening at runtime
because you can get a lot of information, such as class methods, inheritance hierarchies,
and all the living objects in your running program

#### Metaprogramming

Ruby supports metaprogramming, which is a technique that helps you to write code
that creates code on its own. This means it is able to create methods and classes
dynamically. With metaprogramming, you can write methods and classes at runtime,
which helps us to maintain a Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) and maintainable code base.
